As someone who has used both Windows and macOS, I can confidently say that Windows 11 offers several features and design aspects that make it a better choice than macOS, here&#8217;s why.

  1. Customization: One of the biggest advantages of Windows 11 is its customization options. Users can easily change the look and feel of their operating system by downloading and installing themes, wallpapers, and other customization tools. On the other hand, macOS offers very limited customization options, which can be frustrating for users who want to personalize their device.
  2. Hardware Compatibility: Another benefit of Windows 11 is that it is compatible with a broader range of hardware. This includes a variety of laptops, desktop computers, and even gaming systems. This allows users to select from a broader range of devices that are compatible with their operating system. However, macOS is only compatible with Apple hardware, which may be limiting for some users.
  3. Gamers&#8217; Paradise: Windows 11 is a great choice for gamers, as it supports a wider range of games than macOS. Windows 11 has an extensive gaming library that includes popular titles like Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, and many more. On the other hand, macOS has a limited gaming library, making it less appealing to serious gamers.
  4. Price: Windows 11 is also less expensive than macOS. Windows 11 is significantly less expensive than Apple&#8217;s operating system, making it more accessible to a broader range of users. This makes it an excellent choice for those on a tight budget who still require a high-quality operating system.
  5. File Management: Windows 11 also has a more intuitive file management system than macOS. With Windows 11, users can easily access and organize their files with the help of its built-in file explorer. On the other hand, macOS uses a more complicated file management system that can be confusing for some users.
  6. Ease of Use: Windows 11 is also easier to use than macOS. With its straightforward and user-friendly interface, users can easily navigate and access their files, apps, and settings. On the other hand, macOS has a more complex interface that can be overwhelming for some users.

In conclusion, Windows 11 offers a number of advantages over macOS, including customization options, hardware compatibility, gaming support, affordability, intuitive file management, and ease of use. These features make Windows 11 a great choice for those who are looking for a high-quality operating system at an affordable price point.
