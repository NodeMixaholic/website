GNU/Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is widely used by developers, system administrators, and general users alike. If you&#8217;re looking to become a &#8220;based&#8221; GNU/Linux user, here are 7 steps you can take:

  1. Learn the basics: Start by familiarizing yourself with the basics of the operating system, such as how to navigate the file system, use the terminal, and install software. This knowledge will form the foundation for more advanced tasks.
  2. Use the terminal: The terminal is one of the most powerful tools in GNU/Linux, and mastering it is essential for becoming a based user. Get comfortable using basic commands like ls, cd, and rm, and learn how to manipulate files and directories from the terminal.
  3. Get to know your distribution: Different distributions of GNU/Linux have different package managers and software repositories, so it&#8217;s important to know what&#8217;s available for your specific distribution. Learn how to install and update software, and how to use your distribution&#8217;s package manager to manage your system.
  4. Customize your environment: GNU/Linux offers a high level of customization, and personalizing your environment can greatly improve your experience. This includes customizing your desktop, terminal, and other tools to suit your needs and preferences.
  5. Participate in the community: The GNU/Linux community is vast and friendly, and participating in it can be a great way to learn new things, get help with problems, and contribute back. Join online forums, attend meetups, and participate in open-source projects to get involved.
  6. Automate tasks: Automating repetitive tasks can save you time and effort, and is a great way to become more efficient. Use tools like shell scripts, cron jobs, and automation tools to automate common tasks, such as backups, software updates, and system maintenance.
  7. Never stop learning: The beauty of GNU/Linux is that there is always more to learn and explore. Keep up with the latest developments, read technical blogs and articles, and experiment with new tools and technologies to continue improving your skills and knowledge.

By following these steps, you&#8217;ll be well on your way to becoming a based GNU/Linux user. Whether you&#8217;re a beginner or an experienced user, the GNU/Linux community has something to offer, and the journey towards becoming a based user is one that will provide you with endless opportunities for growth and learning.
