If you&#8217;re a fan of Linux and are always on the lookout for new distributions, you may have come across Windows 12. It claims to be a new and improved version of the popular operating system, offering a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. But here&#8217;s the catch – Windows 12 is not what it seems. In reality, it&#8217;s just a lazy rebranding of the popular Linux Lite distribution.

Linux Lite, which was first released in 2012, has become a popular choice among Linux enthusiasts due to its ease of use and low system requirements. It&#8217;s designed specifically for older computers and is highly optimized for performance. This makes it an ideal choice for users who want to run Linux on older hardware without sacrificing performance.

Windows 12, on the other hand, is nothing more than a rebadge of Linux Lite, complete with the same user interface and features. The only difference is the name and the marketing approach. The creators of Windows 12 seem to be trying to pass off Linux Lite as a new and improved version of Windows, complete with a new logo and marketing materials. This approach is not only misleading, but it&#8217;s also funny.

There are several reasons why Windows 12 is a funny rebadge of Linux Lite. Firstly, the name itself is a clear reference to Microsoft Windows, which is one of the most popular operating systems in the world. This is a clear attempt to mislead users into thinking that Windows 12 is a new and improved version of Windows, when in reality, it&#8217;s just Linux Lite.

Another reason why Windows 12 is a funny rebadge is because of its marketing approach. The creators of Windows 12 have gone to great lengths to create a logo and marketing materials that look like those of Microsoft Windows. However, the similarities between Windows 12 and Microsoft Windows are purely superficial. In reality, Windows 12 is a completely different operating system that runs on the Linux kernel.

In conclusion, Windows 12 is a funny rebadge of the popular Linux Lite distribution. Its name and marketing approach are a clear attempt to mislead users into thinking that it&#8217;s a new and improved version of Windows. However, Windows 12 is simply a lazy rebranding of Linux Lite, complete with the same user interface and features. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a new Linux distribution, it&#8217;s best to stick with Linux Lite, which is a well-established and highly optimized distribution that offers a great user experience.
